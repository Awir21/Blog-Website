                    The Next Generation of DC Movies and TV Has Arrived...
                  </h2>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    From the days of Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC has
                    understood the importance of new starts, taking our favorite
                    superheroes in unexpected new directions and establishing a
                    DC Universe that reflects the world of today. It’s certainly
                    been true for our comics, and it’s equally true for our many
                    movies and TV series.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that blockbuster
                    filmmaker James Gunn and producer extraordinaire Peter
                    Safran had been hired as Co-Chairmen and CEOs of DC Studios,
                    the new studio tapped with overseeing all DC film, TV,
                    animation and game projects going forward. Since then, of
                    course, DC fans have all pretty much been wondering the same
                    thing: what new movies and TV series are they working on?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, the wait is over DC fans! Gunn and Safran have
                    unveiled the first ten interconnected DC Studios
                    projects—five movies and five HBO Max TV series. And yes, we
                    said interconnected. All ten of them are set within the same
                    shared universe and will frequently share characters.
                    However, while not included below, there will be films set
                    outside the shared continuity—like the already announced
                    Joker: Folie à Deux from director Todd Phillips and Matt
                    Reeves’ upcoming The Batman sequel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The DCU’s a multiverse, but we’re going to be focusing on
                    one universe from that multiverse,” explains Safran. “And if
                    something isn’t DCU, we’re going to make that very clear.
                    So, strictly adult fare like Todd Phillips’ Joker, or kids
                    animation like Teen Titans Go!, we’re going to make it very
                    clear that those are DC Elseworlds, just the same way that
                    they do it in the comic books.”
                  </p>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc1.jpg" alt="" />
                    <img src="images/dc2.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    But the focus today is on the core, connected DC Universe
                    and the initial shows and TV series that will help it take
                    shape on the screen. Familiar characters like Superman and
                    Batman are obviously represented, but Gunn, Safran and the
                    creative teams they’ve been working with are pulling from
                    unexpected corners of the DC Universe as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Here at DC, we have Metropolis, Gotham, Themyscira,
                    Atlantis, Bialya… This is the world that we’re creating,”
                    Gunn shares. “We’re coming into a world where superheroes
                    exist and have existed for some time in one form or another,
                    and that’s the universe. We are telling a big, huge central
                    story that is like Marvel, except that I think we’re a lot
                    more planned out than Marvel from the beginning because
                    we’ve gotten a group of writers together to work the story
                    out completely.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While all ten of the below projects are in active
                    development, some are further along than others and both
                    Gunn and Safran emphasize that things may shift around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “What we’re starting with today is the first part of the
                    first chapter of our universe,” reveals Safran. “That first
                    chapter’s called ‘Gods and Monsters.’ Many of the following
                    projects are already being worked on, but we’re remaining
                    flexible and we’re going to adjust because we’re never going
                    to put a project into production before the script is right.
                    This is a general timeline, but there will be flexibility
                    within it.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Below, both Gunn and Safran share some details and the
                    thought behind the ten new DC movies and TV series revealed
                    today.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3><strong>Creature Commandos</strong></h3>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc3.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    <em> HBO Max series</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>James Gunn:</strong> The first series that we’re
                    doing, and I’ve already written the entire series, is
                    <em>Creature Commandos</em>. This is an animated TV series
                    and this is art from the animation company that’s doing it.
                    <em>Creature Commandos</em> is based on the great team from
                    DC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What we’re doing with the DCU is we’re having animation tied
                    directly into live action. Television, movies and games all
                    intertwine within the same universe. We’re going to cast
                    actors that are going to be able to play the characters in
                    this, as well as in other things, some of which we’ve
                    already cast. I’ve written all seven episodes of this show
                    and it’s in production now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the image (going from left to right), that's Rick Flag,
                    Sr. He's going to show up in other stuff. Then Nina
                    Mazursky. Doctor Phosphorus, a Batman villain.
                    Frankenstein—Eric Frankenstein, specifically. The Bride of
                    Frankenstein, who's the lead. Finally, G.I. Robot and
                    Weasel.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3><strong>Waller</strong></h3>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc4.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>

                    <em>Live action HBO Max series</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn: </strong>Viola Davis is coming back as her
                    character, Amanda Waller. This is also going to have some of
                    the
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13146488/"
                      ><em>Peacemaker</em></a
                    >
                    team in it as regulars on the show. This basically follows
                    up Peacemaker. We have two great creatives working on it:
                    Christal Henry, who was a writer on
                    <a
                      href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7049682/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
                      ><em>Watchmen,</em></a
                    >
                    and Jeremy Carver who created
                    <a
                      href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8416494/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
                      ><em>Doom Patrol.</em></a
                    >
                    They have this incredibly marvelous story worked out that I
                    think is really fantastic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Peter Safran:</strong> This series will sit between
                    Peacemaker season one and season two.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3><strong>Superman: Legacy</strong></h3>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/hero/1.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    <em>Live action movie</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> (This) is really the launch of the
                    DCU. The first two projects are an amuse-bouche for what’s
                    coming up with <em>Superman: Legacy</em>. James is currently
                    writing it. We’re hoping that he will direct it. It’s not an
                    origin story. It focuses on Superman balancing his
                    Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing. Superman
                    represents truth, justice and the American way. He is
                    kindness in a world that thinks of kindness as old
                    fashioned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> With our stories, we want to take it
                    away from good guy vs. bad guy. There are really good—almost
                    saintly—people and Superman is among them. There are really
                    terrible villains like Gorilla Grodd or the Joker. And then
                    there’s everybody in between them, so there are all these
                    shades of gray which allow us to tell complex stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> And we have a release date for
                    this—July 11, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3><strong>Lanterns</strong></h3>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc5.jpg" alt="" />
                    <img src="images/dc6.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p><em>Live action HBO Max Series</em></p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> Our next project is another
                    television series. We call it Lanterns and it is starring
                    two of our favorite Green <em>Lanterns</em>—Hal Jordan and
                    John Stewart. It’s going to be with HBO Max, as all of our
                    series are that we’re going to talk about today. It is more
                    of a True Detective-type mystery with our two Lanterns. A
                    terrestrial-based mystery—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> —that leads into the overall story
                    that we’re telling throughout the different movies and
                    television shows. We find this ancient horror on Earth, and
                    these guys are basically supercops on “Precinct Earth.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> The story is going to weave back
                    and forth between the films and the television shows.
                    Peacemaker is a good example of how that works, and that’s
                    what we’re going to do with this big overarching story that
                    we’re telling.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3><strong>The Authority</strong></h3>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc7.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p><em>Live Action Movie</em></p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> This is one of my real passion
                    projects. I’ve been working really hard on it with the
                    writers and we’re starting to put together the entire story.
                    This is a big movie. I don’t know how many of you are
                    familiar with the Authority. They’re WildStorm characters.
                    WildStorm was a comics imprint that was bought by DC that I
                    really love. We’re moving a lot of these WildStorm
                    characters into the DCU.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Authority’s a very different kind of superhero story.
                    They are basically good-intentioned, but they think that the
                    world is completely broken and the only way to fix it is to
                    take things into their own hands, whether that means killing
                    people, destroying heads of state, changing
                    governments—basically, whatever they want to do to make the
                    world better. We’ll see how that journey goes for them.

                    There are morally gray characters (in our DCU), of which
                    these are.

                    <strong>PS:</strong> We love that they think the ends
                    justify the means and they’re the ones that decide what the
                    right ends are.

                    <strong>Safran: </strong>This is a Game of Thrones-type
                    story about Themyscira/Paradise Island, home of the Amazons
                    and the birthplace of Wonder Woman. This involves all of the
                    darkness, drama and political intrigue behind this society
                    of only women.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> It’s an origin story of how this
                    society of women came about. What does it mean? What are
                    their politics like? What are their rules? Who’s in charge?
                    What are the games that they play with each other to get to
                    the top? I think it’s really exciting.

                    <strong>Safran:</strong> The events really take place before

                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> This is the introduction of the DCU’s
                    Batman. It is not Robert Pattinson. It is not Ben Affleck.
                    We’re working with Robert on
                    <em>The Batman – Part II</em> with Matt Reeves, and we’re
                    working with Ben Affleck, who has been a part of our team
                    trying to bring things together and he really wants to
                    direct one of our projects. We’re excited for him to do
                    that.

                    This is a story of Damian Wayne, who’s Batman’s actual son
                    that he didn’t know existed for the first eight to ten years
                    of his life. He was raised as a little murderer and
                    assassin. He’s my favorite Robin.

                    <strong>Safran:</strong> This is going to feature other
                    members of the extended Bat-Family. Just because we feel
                    like they’ve been left out of the Batman stories in the
                    theater for far too long.

                    <strong>Safran:</strong> A total fan favorite, as you know.
                    A loser from the future who uses his basic future technology
                    to come back to today to pretend to be a superhero.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> I think of it as basically the story
                    of a superhero’s imposter syndrome. How do you deal with
                    that? (It’s about) how he tries to use this future
                    technology to be loved by the people of today and what is
                    really at the base of that. It’s a character story that’s
                    going to be a very different type of show, and we’re talking
                    to an actor about it now.

                    Tom has been one of the architects of this entire situation.
                    He’s been one of the guys in the room with us, along with
                    four or five other writers. I love his take on these
                    characters. He just turns them slightly to be something very
                    unique.

                    In our story, we have Superman who was sent to Earth and
                    raised by incredibly loving parents. Kara was on Krypton.
                    She was on a piece of Krypton that drifted away from the
                    planet and she lived there for the first fourteen years of
                    her life in a horrible situation where she watched everyone
                    around her die. So, she’s a much harsher and more f*cked up
                    Supergirl than you’ve been used to thus far.

                    <strong>Safran:</strong> The final film we wanted to talk
                    about is Swamp Thing. We bring it up because it’s important
                    to point out that in these stories, although they’re
                    interconnected, they’re not all tonally the same. Each set
                    of filmmakers bring their own aesthetic to these films, and
                    the fun is seeing how these tonally different works mash up
                    in the future.

                  <p>
                    This is a film that will investigate the dark origins of

                    can’t say them. This is the first batch of stuff, but there
                    may be a couple of surprises to come.

                          superheroes those growing pains can come with
                          world-ending consequences if they don't learn how to
                          control themselves.
