                    A Few Cool Things You'll Find as You Play Gotham Knights
                  </h2>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    If you know me, then you know I’m all about hunting for
                    Easter eggs. As such, DC’s latest video game,
                    <a href="https://www.gothamknightsgame.com/en-us"
                      ><em>Gotham Knights</em></a
                    >, seems to be tailor-made for me. Every level, every
                    cutscene, and every corner you can explore is filled with
                    references to comic book storylines and the DC Universe at
                    large. From a reanimated mannequin to a cheekily named law
                    firm to some of Gotham’s hottest bands, here are some of the
                    fun things you’ll find as you play <em>Gotham Knights</em>.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Be sure to check the character emails as you’re playing
                      the game, because there’s a lot to be found there. For
                      example,
                      <em>Lois Lane</em> emails <em>Dick Grayson</em> about a
                      new Blüdhaven vigilante named Nite-Wing, which is a
                      reference to a storyline from the
                      <em>’90s Nightwing series</em>. <em>Roy Harper</em> emails
                      Jason, referencing the time they traveled together in
                      <em>Red Hood and the Outlaws</em>. I could spend an entire
                      article talking about the emails alone! Look for messages
                      from other superheroes, deep-cut supporting characters and
                      other bits of fun.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc16.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Speaking of emails, there is one message that appears to
                      be the <em>DC Universe</em> version of the famous Nigerian
                      prince scam, except Markovia is the country in question.
                      Markovia is a fictional European country that is home to
                      Geo-Force and his sister Terra. The country was first seen
                      in 1983’s <em>Batman and the Outsiders #1</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      I spotted some photos of Ace the Bat-Hound while exploring
                      the kitchen in the Belfry. The Bat-Family’s loveable pet
                      first appeared in <em>1955’s Batman #92</em> and recently
                      co-starred in the animated film
                      <em>DC League of Super-Pets</em>. He’s also a good boy.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc17.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      While you’re in the Belfry’s kitchen, take a look at the
                      top of the refrigerator. You’ll find a box of cereal
                      called <em>“Flakies”</em> with references to the superhero
                      <em>Booster Gold</em>. Flakies were actually referenced in
                      <em
                        >Booster Gold’s first appearance in 1985’s Booster Gold
                        #1</em
                      >, and he could be seen filming a commercial for the
                      breakfast in the following issue.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The Belfry contains a <em>Spy Hunter</em> arcade cabinet,
                      and you can even play it! If you do, check out the high
                      scores. CLA, HEL and DIN are listed. Does this mean
                      <em>Clark Kent</em>, Helena Bertinelli and Dinah Lance
                      have visited the Belfry and played the game?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      As you make your way through the <em>GCPD</em>, keep an
                      eye out for the villainous puppet Scarface. Batman’s
                      wooden enemy is usually seen alongside his associate the
                      Ventriloquist. The inanimate mobster first appeared in
                      <em>Detective Comics #583</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc18.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Tim Drake’s desk has a photo of him with Superboy. In the
                      comics, <em>Robin and Superboy</em> are best friends. Tim
                      and Conner first met in Superboy/Robin: World’s Finest
                      Three and their bond grew during their time serving
                      together in Young Justice and the <em>Teen Titans</em>. An
                      email from Conner to Tim also appears in the game.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      While visiting <em>Gotham University</em>, you’ll find a
                      science exhibit referencing Niles Caulder’s work in
                      neuroscience. If you’re a fan of the Doom Patrol, then you
                      know that is probably not a good thing. You’ll also see a
                      reference to a cellular fusion research experiment from
                      Erdid Orson and Gilbert Giles. Orson was a villainous
                      scientist who first appeared in
                      <em>2014’s Aquaman #28</em>. Giles was a college professor
                      who helped turn Hank Heywood into the superhero Steel. He
                      was introduced in <em>1978’s Steel #1</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A poster advertising a <em>Black Canary</em> concert can
                      be seen in the upper levels of the Belfry. The show is
                      titled <em>“Kicking and Screaming,”</em> which is also the
                      name of the trade paperback collecting the first arc of
                      her 2015 series. Dinah’s show is at the Monarch Theater,
                      which was first named in the 1989 Batman film. An email
                      from Dinah to Babs also appears in the game.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc19.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Speaking of musicians, posters throughout the city
                      advertise a concert by a band called
                      <em>Brother Power the Geek</em>. This is a reference to an
                      obscure Silver Age comic called Brother Power the Geek
                      which starred a mannequin that came to life.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The Monarch Theater has posters advertising performances
                      from the magician <em>Zatara</em> and the band Mucous
                      Membrane. Zatara was a magic-based superhero who actually
                      predates Batman. He first appeared in
                      <em>1938’s Action Comics #1</em>, the same comic that
                      introduced Superman. Mucous Membrane is
                      <em>John Constantine’s band</em>, which was first seen in
                      <em>1988’s Hellblazer #11</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      While in <em>Kirk Langstrom’s lab</em>, look for a poster
                      of the <em>Gray Ghost</em>, a pulp hero Bruce Wayne
                      idolized during his boyhood in
                      <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. The character,
                      voiced by Adam West, was introduced in the episode
                      <em>“Beware the Gray Ghost.”</em> As a bonus, a calendar
                      next to the poster has the date November 4th, 1992—the
                      same day the episode originally aired.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc20.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Speaking of Adam West, while swinging through the city you
                      might spot a billboard advertising the fictional law firm
                      of West & Ward. This is a reference to Adam West and his
                      co-star Burt Ward, who portrayed the Dynamic Duo in the
                      1966 <em>Batman television series</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <em>Thirsty?</em> While making your way through Gotham,
                      look out for Noonan’s Bar, the infamous villain hangout
                      which was introduced in <em>The Demon Annual #2</em>. The
                      bar is heavily featured in
                      <em>HBO Max’s Harley Quinn</em>, and will soon be the
                      focus of a spin-off starring Kite Man. Hell yeah!
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/dc21.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Or maybe you’re hungry? You’ll also find a Big Belly
                      Burger restaurant. The fictional fast food chain has been
                      a part of the DC Universe since Adventures of
                      <em>Superman #441</em> and has been heavily referenced in
                      The CW’s “Arrowverse.”
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Speaking of the <em>Arrowverse</em>, while exploring
                      Gotham, see if you can spot Jitters, Central City’s iconic
                      coffee shop.
                      <em
                        >(Apparently, they’ve franchised out to Gotham City as
                        well.)</em
                      >
                      Jitters was first seen in <em>2010’s The Flash #1</em> and
                      the coffee shop is a key location on The Flash television
                      series.

                    <li>
                      <em>Jacob Kane</em> has quite the weapons collection! Kane
                      has a katana from Tatsu Yamashiro, and guns from
                      <em>Tallulah Black and Frank Rock</em>. Tatsu is the
                      superhero <em>Katana</em>, Tallulah Black is an associate
                      of the western gunslinger Jonah Hex, and Frank Rock is the
                      given name of DC war hero <em>Sgt. Rock</em>.

                      If you go to the Belfry’s upper levels, you’ll spot a
                      poster advertising a performance by the
                      <em>Flying Graysons</em>. This was Dick Grayson’s family
                      circus act before his parents were killed by Tony Zucco in
                      <em>1940’s Detective Comics #38</em>. The poster lists
                      Robinson Park as the performance venue. Robinson Park was
                      named after the Golden Age artist Jerry Robinson and was
                      first mentioned in <em>Batman: Year One</em>.

                      Back out in Gotham City proper, look for a giant billboard
                      advertising Janus Perfume. It’s probably not a good idea
                      to use it. As detailed in <em>Batman #386</em>, Janus is
                      owned by Roman Sionis (otherwise known as the
                      <em>Black Mask</em>) and his cosmetics have been known to
                      disfigure people.

                    <li>
                      As you explore the <em>Iceberg Lounge</em>, you might
                      notice that Oswald has kept some trophies from other
                      <em>DC villains</em>, including some boomerangs from
                      <em>Captain Boomerang and the Clock King’s hat</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      During a few points in the game, Tim will mention his
                      relationship with Bernard Dowd. Tim and Bernard’s romantic
                      relationship began in
                      <em>Batman: Urban Legends #6</em> and another version of
                      it is currently playing out on <em>HBO Max’s Titans</em>.

                    <li>
                      If you wander around outside of Gotham Hospital, you’ll
                      find a plaque paying tribute to Neal Adams, a
                      groundbreaking DC artist who passed away earlier this
                      year. Neal Adams drew some of Batman’s most iconic Bronze
                      Age adventures and co-created <em>Ra’s al Ghul</em> and
                      <em>Kirk Langstrom</em>, two characters featured
                      prominently in the game.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Similarly, in Old Gotham you might come across a plaque
                      memorializing George Pérez, who passed away earlier this
                      year. Pérez was a legendary artist and writer who helped
                      to shape the current <em>DC Universe</em> as we know it.
                      Perhaps most famously, he co-created the
                      <em>New Teen Titans</em> along with Marv Wolfman. Perez
                      and Wolfman were also responsible for transforming
                      <em>Dick Grayson into Nightwing</em>, so in a way, this
                      game wouldn’t have been possible without him.

                    Honestly, I have a feeling I’m just scratching the surface
                    with these. Just about every time I’ve explored the open
                    world within <em>Gotham Knights</em>, I’ve found something
                    cool that I hadn’t noticed before. I encourage you to do
                    your own Easter egg hunting as you play (or replay) the game
                    and let us know what you find!
