                    James Gunn and Peter Safran on Building a New DC Universe
                  </h2>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    The recently hired Co-Chairmen and CEOs of the new DC
                    Studios have the weight of the universe on their
                    shoulders—the DC Universe, that is. But it’s okay, they have
                    plenty of superhero friends they can call on for assistance,
                    from Superman and Batman, to Swamp Thing and Booster Gold,
                    to…well, pretty much everyone ever created for DC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since being placed in charge of DC’s upcoming slate of films
                    and TV series, the two newly minted execs had to hit the
                    ground running, kickstarting the development process for
                    their first batch of projects—<a
                      href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe"
                    >
                      <em>ten of which were announced this morning—while</em></a
                    >
                    shepherding already existing DC films and TV shows forward.
                    Unsurprisingly, finding ways for it all to coexist was not
                    without its challenges, but by Gunn’s own admission, they
                    were aided by some good fortune.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                    “I think that we’ve gotten lucky with the next four movies
                    because we have Shazam, which leads into Flash, which resets
                    everything, which then goes into Blue Beetle, which is
                    totally disconnected (from everything that came before) and
                    can be a part of the DCU, which goes into Aquaman, which
                    leads into Superman: Legacy, our first big project,” he
                    explains. “But the one thing that we can promise is that
                    everything from our first project forward will be canon and
                    will be connected. We’re using some actors from the past,
                    we’re not using other actors from the past, but everything
                    from that moment forward will be connected and consistent.”

                  <p>
                    A key part of DC’s film and television on the near horizon
                    amounts to a combination of both new and already
                    established. Along with new projects like Superman: Legacy,
                    Creature Commandos, The Brave and the Bold and The
                    Authority, fans can expect a few highly anticipated
                    follow-ups, like director Matt Reeves’ The Batman – Part II,
                    which

                    It’s a lot to keep track of, even for superfans like us, so
                    Gunn and Safran recently answered some questions about
                    everything brewing at DC Studios to help give fans a sense
                    of how it will all come together.

                    <strong>
                      why a shared universe is the right approach going
                      forward…</strong
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Safran:</strong> DC has had great individual movies
                    over the years, but we think that what the audience really
                    appreciates and needs is a connected universe. It minimizes
                    audience confusion and it maximizes their connectivity to it
                    across all the platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Gunn:</strong> I think that’s something that people
                    love. I know that from my own experience. But again, we do
                    have Elseworlds tales we’re telling. The bar for an
                    Elseworlds tale is going to be higher than the bar for a
                    movie within the DCU. Not that we’re not always going to
                    have a high bar, but it’s got to be something really special
                    for us to tell that story outside of our regular continuity
                    and to spend the money to make it.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> Probably two movies and two HBO Max
                    series per year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      how they decide which medium to use for which
                      project…</strong

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> It’s all story-based. To us,
                    storytelling is 100% king. So, if it’s a story that’s more
                    complicated, like the <em>Lanterns</em> or
                    <em>Waller</em> story, or has more of an independent TV
                    vibe, like <em>Booster Gold</em>, then that’s more suited
                    for television. It has to do with tone, storytelling and if
                    it’s something that we can tell in two hours and ten
                    minutes. Or is it something that we need seven, eight or
                    nine hours for?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> We certainly debated a couple of
                    these projects and where they fit better, but ultimately,
                    this is where we landed.

                      how they decide on ratings and whether something should be
                      live action or animated…</strong
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Gunn:</strong> It depends on the story. We’re going
                    to give every story what it deserves. Some things we know.
                    <em>Superman</em> is definitely something we know we’d like
                    to be PG-13, so I’m going to make sure it is. Other things,
                    like the <em>Waller</em> TV show, are a little bit more
                    mature. And we have other things that are aimed a bit more
                    at young women or at kids that are still within this world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> And in terms of animation, it’s
                    sometimes just a fun way to introduce characters or
                    introduce stories that would frankly be too expensive to be
                    done otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Gunn:</strong> Creature Commandos is a good example
                    of that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Safran:</strong> With Creature Commandos, they’re
                    all digital characters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      On whether they’re planning any big, Justice League-type
                      crossover events…</strong

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Gunn:</strong> Everything’s crossing over
                    throughout. These characters are all interacting throughout
                    the different stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, it doesn’t necessarily mean always. Brave and the Bold
                    may just be Batman, Robin and the characters involved in
                    that. But I know a lot of other times these characters cross
                    around. In Creature Commandos, one of the main characters
                    shows up in <em>Waller</em>.

                    Superman movie come out and have this Superman game come
                    out. It’s more like we’ll have the Superman film come out,
                    then maybe two years later, we have the Supergirl movie
                    coming out. So, what’s the story in between there? Is there
                    a Krypto game that we can play that comes in between them?
                    Something that’s still set in the world with these
                    characters, but is its own thing. We want to give the
                    prominence to games that they deserve.

                    <strong> Matt Reeves’ Batman films will continue…</strong>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> Yes. Matt is working on
                    <em>The Batman – Part II</em>, which he thinks of as a
                    Batman crime saga that also includes <em>the Penguin</em> TV
                    series. The Batman is its own thing. Matt’s hard at work on
                    it. He came in and pitched us some amazing stuff the other
                    day, so our plan is for that to continue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Safran:</strong> Also, The Batman’s not a stepchild.
                    It’s all under DC. We are fully invested in the success of
                    <em>The Batman</em> just like we are everything else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Gunn:</strong> Of course, everything’s going to be
                    balanced so The Brave and the Bold is not going to be coming
                    out in the same six month period as The Batman.

                  <p>
                    <strong> Safran:</strong> It’s too early to say. Jason
                    always thought Aquaman was a trilogy in his own mind, but he
                    also loves Lobo. He’s been very clear about that too. He’s
                    never going to play two characters…

                  <p>

                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> We’re dealing with all that. Some of
                    that stuff will continue as Elseworlds, but a lot of other
                    stuff we’re starting to bring into animation with (Warner
                    Bros. Animation President) Sam Register so that we’ll have
                    things that are connected with this. I think there have been
                    a lot of really marvelous DC cartoons, so we’re going to
                    keep moving forward with that.

                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> We’re very close to Andy Muschietti
                    and Barbara Muschietti, the director and producer of
                    <em>The Flash</em>. Andy’s going to be doing some more stuff

                    sh*t before I took the job. So it’s me; him; Christal Henry,
                    who worked on <em>Watchmen;</em> Christina Hodson, who wrote
                    <em>The Flash</em>; Drew Goddard, who you probably know; and
                    Jeremy Slater, who just did <em>Moon Knight</em>. That’s the
                    group of people we’ve been meeting with and putting all of
                    this together.

                    <strong>Gunn:</strong> Even though this is all a connected
                    universe, it’s really important to me that the individual
                    writers and directors on the projects give their own
                    self-expression to it, just like they do in the comics.
                    Everything doesn’t always look the same. Everything doesn’t
                    always have the same expression. Different artists bring
                    remarkably different looks, feels and tones. This is not the
                    Gunnverse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I want each project to have the feelings of the individual
                    artist that’s working on it and to give them a lot of
                    freedom—as long as it works—to create something special
                    because what I’ve found through <em>Marvel</em>, what wasn’t
                    exciting was when movies were tonally the same. What was
                    exciting was when you had something like Guardians come out
                    and everyone was like, “How is this raccoon going to be
                    dealing with this God of Thunder? That’s going to be weird.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But then when you actually see the mash-up happen, that’s
                    what makes it so fun. So, to see seemingly tonally
                    incongruent things come together is part of the fun of all
                    this.

                          writer share what they'll be reading over the weekend
                          and why you might want to check it out. Here's this
                          week's suggestion for a perfect Weekend Escape!
